This is an exercise for the Odin Project where I am tasked
with making a simple recipe website

In doing this project I should get a firmer grasp of 
some concepts such as

-setting up an html boilerplate
-using html elements such as
    <p>
    <a>
    <img>
-making relative and absolute references to links and images
